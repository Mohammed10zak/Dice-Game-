# Dice-Game-(‚åê‚ñ†_‚ñ†)
In this project you'll be creating a Dice Game to flex your DOM manipulation skills.

This project should not be easy for you.
You'll probably have to Google frequently to get the right JavaScript methods and CSS to use - in fact,
that's the point! You can build this using the tools that you have already learned and there are plenty
of resources on the net for learning stuff that we haven't covered yet if you decide you need it.
We'll walk you through the basic steps, but it will be up to you to actually implement them.

If you get totally stuck drop by the discord server, someone there will be able to point you in the right direction.

Dice game a simple game.
Players take turns to roll a single dice as many times as they wish,
adding all roll results to a running total, but losing their gained score for the turn if they roll a 1.
